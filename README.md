### Predictive Analysis for Manufacturing Operations
Overview
This project provides a RESTful API to predict machine downtime or production defects using manufacturing data. The API includes endpoints for uploading data, training a machine learning model, and making predictions.

Features
Upload Data: Upload a CSV file containing the manufacturing dataset.
Train Model: Train a supervised machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Decision Tree) on the uploaded data.
Make Predictions: Use JSON input to predict machine downtime or production defects.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Framework: Flask
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Data Processing: Pandas
Serialization: Pickle
Installation
